/**
 * Timer that can run TimerTasks at a later time.
 * TimerTasks can be scheduled for one time execution at some time in the
 * future. They can be scheduled to be rescheduled at a time period after the
 * task was last executed. Or they can be scheduled to be executed repeatedly
 * at a fixed rate.
 * <p>
 * The normal scheduling will result in a more or less even delay in time
 * between successive executions, but the executions could drift in time if
 * the task (or other tasks) takes a long time to execute. Fixed delay
 * scheduling guarantees more or less that the task will be executed at a
 * specific time, but if there is ever a delay in execution then the period
 * between successive executions will be shorter. The first method of
 * repeated scheduling is prefered for repeated tasks in response to user
 * interaction, the second method of repeated scheduling is prefered for tasks
 * that act like alarms.
 * <p>
 * The Timer keeps a binary heap as a task priority queue which means that
 * scheduling and serving of a task in a queue of n tasks costs O(log n).
 *
 * @see TimerTask
 * @since 1.3
